# authPhp
Authentication Program with Core PHP
    Install a Local Web Server (optional): If you want to run PHP code on your local machine for testing and development purposes, 
    you can install a local web server with PHP support. 
    Some popular options are XAMPP, WAMP, or MAMP (depending on your operating system) or IIS.
    Start the Web Server (if using a local server): If you installed a local web server (e.g., XAMPP), start the server and make sure PHP is enabled.
    Place the PHP File in the Web Server's Root Directory (if using a local server): 
    For local servers like XAMPP, place the the AuthApp Project file in the htdocs or www folder (depending on your server).
    Access the PHP File in a Web Browser: Open your web browser and enter the URL to access your PHP file. 
    If you are using a local server, the URL would typically be http://localhost/index.php or similar, depending on the server configuration and the location of your file.
    View the Output: The PHP code will be executed on the server, and the output will be displayed in your web browser.
